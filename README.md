# Learning styled components

Having tried tailwind CSS i thought it would be good to try a different way of styling my projects in React and looked into styled components. The docs are very well maintained and many resources and videos out there to help. I like how you can create each component and display all data and then have the styled compnents right above in the same file ready to style. I also liked how this followed standard CSS naming rather than Tailwind's shorthand. Overall though was easy to implement and sure there is much more to discover with it.

Implemented a sliding landing page too with some basic javascript that rotates between four images.
